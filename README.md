# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

##Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of employees eligible for retirement and for a mentorship program. The request was to sort these deliverables by their employee number and filter by birtdate in order to determine eligibility.

##Results

Based on the retiring titles csv, over 70% of the eligible retirees, or 50,842 employees, are Senior Staff or Senior Engineers. 
	- 25,916 Senior Engineers
	- 24,926 Senior Staff

This totals 17% of all employees at Pewlett-Hackard. 

An additional 738 Senior Staff and Senior Engineers are elible for the mentorship program, or 48% of the total eligible pool. 

##Summary

The US Bureau Labor Statistics tracks turnover rates by industry. Professional and business services hovers between a 5.1-5.6% turnover rate (https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.t03.htm). Pewlett-Hackard is looking at a 17% turnover rate if all eligible employees retire at the end of the year. That does not include any employees that would leave voluntarily for other opportunities. Due to this large scale retirement, my recommendation is that Packard-Hewlett offer voluntary retirement packages based on years of service, in order to space out the amount of employees retiring at once. Packard-Hewlett should also look at promoting staff and engineers to senior positions, and fill the vacant staff and engineer positions. This would allow a wider pool of candidates as the requirements are not as strenuous as Senior level positions.
